# gcloudrig

A collection of bash scripts that use [Google's Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) to create and maintain a cloud gaming instance, on the cheap.

Requires `bash`, `gcloud` and `python2.7.x` (required by `gcloud`); or just use [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/).

## Prerequisites
-  bash
-  python 2.7.x
-  [gcloud sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)

### Specs
-  8 vCPU (n1-standard-8)
-  NVIDIA Tesla P4 (nvidia-tesla-p4-vws)
-  50GB SSD (pd-ssd)
-  500GB Storage (pd-standard)
-  Windows Server 2016 (windows-2016)

*Cloud responsibly. These scripts are provided as-is, with zero support. At the very least, create a new GCP project.*

## One-time setup
-  [Start Cloud Shell in a new project](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/starting-cloud-shell)

   Alternatively, run `gcloud init`

-  [Ensure billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) for this new project.

-  Clone this repository
       $ git clone "https://github.com/putty182/gcloudrig"

-  Run `setup.sh`
        $ cd "gcloudrig"
        $ ./setup.sh

-  If anything goes wrong during setup, start over with these commands
        $ ./destroy.sh
        $ gcloud init
        $ ./setup.sh


## Starting your rig
- Run `./scale-up.sh` to start your instance.

- Run `./reset-windows-password.sh` to get the IP, Username and Password you'll need to RDP to your instance and start installing software.

  Alternatively, visit [Compute Engine > VM Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) to set a password and download an RDP file.  See [Creating Passwords for Windows Instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/creating-passwords-for-windows-instances) and [Connecting to Windows Instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#windows) for more info.

## Stopping your rig
- Run `./scale-down.sh` to shutdown your instance.

  Once stopped, it will take a few minutes to create a copy of both boot and games disks.  Read *Disk maintenance* below for more info.

## Install a bunch of things (Recommended)
Once you've started your rig, it will be empty.  There are no pre-installed software or drivers (...yet)

Follow these steps to get a stable "gaming" setup:

- Install [GRIDÂ® drivers for virtual workstations](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/add-gpus#installing_gridwzxhzdk37_drivers_for_virtual_workstations)

- Install [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/)

- Setup [Autologon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/sysinternals/downloads/autologon) to avoid a login screen at boot

- Install [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/), create/join a network, and set it to run on boot by right-clicking it's icon in the system tray

- Install [TightVNC Server](https://www.tightvnc.com/) and lock it down to zerotier's IP range (e.g. `allow 10.147.17.0-10.147.17.255`; `deny 0.0.0.0-255.255.255`).  Test a VNC connection using your instance's ZeroTier IP now.

- Reboot to finish GPU driver installation.

- Login with TightVNC, set display to "Show only on Monitor 2" and give it an appropriate screen resolution.  This will disable the primary 640x480 virtual screen, which can't be resized and gives Parsec headaches when games try to launch on it.

- Attempt to change the volume; Windows should prompt that the Windows Sound service isn't running.  Start it.  Alternatviely, run `services.msc` and change it's startup options there.

- Install [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/), save login details, and set it to run on boot by right-clicking it's icon in the system tray

- Install game clients (e.g. Steam) and a game or two.

- (Optional) Signup at [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) and create a hostname for the private ZeroTier IP (NOT the public one).  If you really want a hostname for the dynamic public IP as well, create a secondary hostname and pick your favourite set of installation instructions.

- (Optional) Edit `default-allow-rdp` firewall rule in Cloud Console, change it's `Targets` to `Specified target tags` and add a target tag of `rdp-server`, so only instances with the network tag `rdp-server` have public RDP ports.  If you really need to RDP into the public IP address, add this network tag to a running instance.

## Notes
Avoid using RDP since it'll disconnect your "physical" session on the virtual monitor.  Doing so will show the windows lock screen on the virtual monitor, which upsets most streaming clients.  If you find yourself in this situation, connect using VNC to fix the issue or just use RDP anyway and restart the instance.

Whenever connecting to your instance, you should always use the ZeroTier IP. Only open up your instance's Public IP if that few extra milliseconds of software networking lag is worth foregoing basic network security.

## Travelling?
gcloudrig keeps your rig as a boot image and disk snapshot, both of which are globally available in GCE.

To run your rig in a different part of the world, just `./setup.sh` again and change your default region.
